# Cinema_Room_REST_Service_with_Java

This is the Cinema Room REST Service project I made myself.

What can be better than watching a movie in a cinema? Managing a cinema room seamlessly with a modern RESTful API! In this project, you'll program a backend service using Java and Spring Boot to simulate the operations of a cinema room.

The service provides a RESTful API to manage seats, reservations, and ticket purchases. Users can view available seats, book tickets, and see statistics like the total income and the number of purchased tickets. The system ensures that users can only book available seats and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive operations.

This project demonstrates key concepts of Java programming and web development:

Building a RESTful API using Spring Boot.
Managing data using OOP principles such as classes, objects, and methods.
Implementing core backend functionalities like request handling, validation, and responses.
Practicing structured programming with loops, conditions, and exception handling.
Through this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:

Setting up a Spring Boot application from scratch.
Implementing GET and POST endpoints to handle HTTP requests.
Handling data persistence and implementing business logic.
Gaining a deeper understanding of RESTful services, web APIs, and backend development.
This project is perfect for learning the basics of REST API design, working with Java, and diving into the world of backend development.
